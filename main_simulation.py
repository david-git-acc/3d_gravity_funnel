# The purpose of this program is to create a 3D simulation of balls travelling along a funnel surface
# The model is based off the black hole simulation at the National Space Centre in Leicester, UK
# After running the simulation, the goal is to collect data and results about the balls such as their
# kinetic energy, number of collisions, etc and vary the settings of the simulation to analyse it 
# and find conclusions about how mainly the friction, coefficient of restitution but also other
# factors such as collision frequency affect the kinetic energy,velocity, etc over time of these balls.

# MODELLING ASSUMPTIONS:

# 1. Balls are placed on the surface of the funnel with some initial horizontal velocity - they have no vertical velocity 
#   ( a safe assumption since any vertical velocity would be stopped by the normal reaction force of the ball)
#
# 2. Negligible air resistance to the motion of the balls, as they have small surface area
#
# 3. There are no forces acting on the balls other than weight and friction, which is a constant multiple of the normal reaction
#
# 4. Energy can only be lost through friction or collisions via the coefficient of restitution, e
#
# 5. The balls have equal density - the greater the volume of the ball, the heavier the ball
#
# 6. Gravity/weight of the balls will acts act in the direction of steepest gradient descent
#
# 7. Collisions between balls can occur, but only between pairs of balls at any given timeframe 
#   (the smaller the timestep, the less this becomes an issue since 3-ball collisions are much rarer than 2-ball ones)
#
# 8. All balls are modelled as perfect spheres with uniform radii.

# STARTING FEATURES AND IMPORTANT STORAGE ARRAYS
# NOTE: All positions and velocities will be stored as complex numbers - the real part represents the x-coordinate
# and the imaginary part the y-coordinate - this was done to make coding easier and utilise python support for complex numbers

# This array stores the positions of the balls - the values here are their initial positions
position = 0.75*np.array([2+3j, 3-3.8j, 1-1j, 3+3j])

# This array stores the velocities of the balls - the values here are their initial velocities
velocity = 4* np.array([1-1.25j,-1-0.75j, -0.9+1.1j, 0.76+1.2j])

# Array to check each ball to see if it's currently in collision with a wall
# Needed to avoid triggering the wall collision code more than once for a single collision
collidedwithwallalready = np.array([False] * len(position))

# Array that stores the array indices of balls which have collided with each other
# Each element is of the form [a b] where a,b are the indices of the colliding balls
# Again needed to avoid triggering the same collision code more than once for a single collision

# This array stores the positions in xy coordinates, of where balls have collided with the wall boundary
# over the course of the entire simulation

# also over the course of the entire simulation
