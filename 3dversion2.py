# The purpose of this program is to create a 3D simulation of balls travelling along a funnel surface
# The model is based off the black hole simulation at the National Space Centre in Leicester, UK
# After running the simulation, the goal is to collect data and results about the balls such as their
# kinetic energy, number of collisions, etc and vary the settings of the simulation to analyse it 
# and find conclusions about how mainly the friction, coefficient of restitution but also other
# factors such as collision frequency affect the kinetic energy,velocity, etc over time of these balls.

# STARTING FEATURES AND IMPORTANT STORAGE ARRAYS
# NOTE: All positions and velocities will be stored as complex numbers - the real part represents the x-coordinate
# and the imaginary part the y-coordinate - this was done to make coding easier and utilise python support for complex numbers

# This array stores the positions of the balls - the values here are their initial positions
position = 0.75*np.array([2+3j, 3-3.8j, 1-1j, 3+3j])

# This array stores the velocities of the balls - the values here are their initial velocities
velocity = 4* np.array([1-1.25j,-1-0.75j, -0.9+1.1j, 0.76+1.2j])

# Array to check each ball to see if it's currently in collision with a wall
# Needed to avoid triggering the wall collision code more than once for a single collision
collidedwithwallalready = np.array([False] * len(position))

# Array that stores the array indices of balls which have collided with each other
# Each element is of the form [a b] where a,b are the indices of the colliding balls
# Again needed to avoid triggering the same collision code more than once for a single collision
balls_collided_already = np.array([])

# This array stores the positions in xy coordinates, of where balls have collided with the wall boundary
# over the course of the entire simulation
boundary_collision_markers = np.array([])

# This array stores the positions in xy coordinates, of where balls have collided with each other
# also over the course of the entire simulation
ball_collision_markers = np.array([])

# The colour map we'll use for the 3D surface to show higher and lower altitude points more clearly
cmap = plt.get_cmap("gnuplot")

# Generate the plot - "computed_zorder" fixes a bug in matplotlib where the balls constantly appear to be below the surface
fig, ax = plt.subplots( figsize = figsize, subplot_kw={"projection" : "3d", "computed_zorder" : False})

# In order to maintain the same overall simulation speed, as dt decreases and each frame has less effect on the simulation,
# need to add more frames in the same time slot to keep up the same speed - hence reciprocal relationship
